## Usage

myCraftedBoard was designed to be simple and lightweight. You only have to open the index.html file in your favourite browser to access to your board.  

The management of tasks and the general configuration of the board requires manual editing of JSON data files with just a text editor.  

A configuration and a tasks list are provided as an example.


### Configuration

To set up the configuration, you have to edit the board.config.js file.  

You can configure:
* the board title
* the refresh interval
* the user name, initials and avatar
* the delays for alerts on planned tasks
* the tags which will can used to classify tasks

More detailed information on how to correctly configure the board are available in the [board.config.js](https://github.com/jctophefabre/mycraftedboard/blob/master/board.config.js) example file.

### Tasks

To manage the tasks, you have to edit the board.tasks.js file.  
This files allows to define lanes (such as "Todo","In progress", "Done") and tasks in lanes.  

A lane is a list of tasks.
A task is a string formatted with optional tags, an optional planned date and a text.  
The following example defines a task tagget for "Project X" and "Development", planned to be completed on "December 8th of 2020" and detailed with message "Fix bug #42".

```
"[projectx][dev]!2020-12-08 Fix bug #42"
``` 
Tasks can be moved from one lane to another using copy-paste in the file editor.

More detailed information on how to manage lanes and tasks are available in the [board.tasks.js](https://github.com/jctophefabre/mycraftedboard/blob/master/board.config.js) example file.


## Tips

* To share a board with others people, you can store it in a network shared folder or a drive system such as Nextcloud, Dropbox, iCloud, ... as myCraftedBoard is only a matter of files!
